Dr. Shreejith Shanker is an tenured Assistant Professor at the [Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/) at [Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland](https://www.tcd.ie), since April 2019. Dr. Shanker heads the teaching and research activities in the area of digital systems design, adaptive architectures and high-performance accelerators. 

He graduated with a Bachelors degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from the [University of Kerala](https://www.keralauniversity.ac.in/) in 2006 and a PhD degree from [Nanyang Technological University](http://ntu.edu.sg) and [Technical University of Munich](http://tum.de) in 2016. 

He started his professional career in 2006 as a Design Engineer at [Processor Systems India](http://procsys.com) where he was involved in design and verification of high-speed custom logic for network switches and compute accelerators. Later, he joined the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, one of the premier research centres under the [Indian Space Research Organisation](http://isro.gov.in) as a Scientist working on design of real-time, mission critical subsystems for launch vehicles and satellite systems. 
On completion of his PhD, Dr. Shanker joined as a post-doctoral research fellow at the [Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Research/HESL/Pages/Home.aspx), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore where he was working on cognitive radio architectures and techniques for commercial and aeronautical communication systems. 
Subsequently, Dr. Shanker was a Teaching Fellow at the [School of Engineering](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/), The University of Warwick, UK from 2017 to 2018, where he continued his research on in-network computation and accelerators, while developing and delivering modules on Computer Architecture and Programming to the undergraduate cohort. 
He briefly took up the role of Research Fellow at the [Electrification Suite and Test Lab](https://www.tum-create.edu.sg/research/electrification-suite-test-lab) , TUM CREATE Ltd, Singapore, investigating decentralised IoT in smart energy systems and power grids before taking up the role of Assistant Professor at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. 

His current research explores reconfigurable architectures and frameworks for distributed accelerators that are tightly coupled to the compute/network fabric, with application to autonomous systems, media processing and communication networks.
