*** 

Shashwat Khandelwal successfully defended his PhD thesis on May 27, 2025. His thesis explores deep-learning techniques and optimisations for effective intrusion detection strategies for in-vehicle networks.

Key contributions of his work include the exploration of model compression and optimisation strategies to meet real-time requirements with limited energy and computational resources, and subsequently arriving at a smart network controller architecture that completely encapsulates intrusion detection logic, making it fully transparent to the application. He also worked closely with the AMD research team in Dublin, led by Dr. Michaela Blott, for developing a generalisable extension for accelerating time series models on FPGAs.

The examination committee consisted of Prof. Diana Goehringer, Chair of Adaptive Systems at TU Dresden, Dr. Declan O'Loughlin, Assistant Professor at TCD, and Prof. Biswajit Basu, Professor of Civil Structural and Environmental Engineering.

I want to thank the collaborators at AMD research labs, Dr. Micheala Blott, Jakoba Petri-König, Thomas Preußer and others for the fruitful partnership, and to AMD's University Program team (Cathal McCabe, Mario Ruiz and others) for supporting our research. Thanks also to Nvidia for supporting our research through the GPU grant. 

Congratulations, Dr. Khandelwal, and best wishes for your success in your new role at ARM.
