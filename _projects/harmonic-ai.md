[Harmonic-AI](https://www.seai.ie/seai-research/research-database/research-projects/details/harmonicai--harmonic-management-with-ai-for-networks-to-intelligently-enhance-ev-charging-and-gridtied-microgeneration-at-customer-sites) explores the design of novel embedded detection, management and control schemes for limiting the harmonic components injected into the electricity grid from high-power EV charging infrastructure and distributed energy resources. This joint project between RCSL (TCD) and TU Dublin is funded by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). As the TCD lead, we aim to develop efficient and lightweight deep learning models to estimate harmonic components at each node (in a distributed fashion and also at an aggregate level) and provide optimisation strategies to mitigate their effect on the grid. The research team at TUD will develop intelligent controllers that can deploy these optimisations at different levels of granularity. TCD work packages are being developed by [Changhong Li](), PhD candidate, who joined our team in April 2025.
