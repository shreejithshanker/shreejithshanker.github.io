The project explores the case for line rate intrusion detection using deep learning models for in-vehicle networks such as Controller Area Networks and Ethernet. The key contributions of this research are 
-- Developing highly quantised DL models with state-of-the-art detection performance
-- Dataflow mapping optimisations and development of custom layers 
-- Tight integration into the Network controller's  datapath without affecting protocol functionality or incurring additional latency in message movement

The project is supported by the Department of EEE through a PhD scholarship.
