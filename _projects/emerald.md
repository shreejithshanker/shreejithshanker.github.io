[EMERALD](https://www.upf.edu/web/emerald) is a Horizon EU project partners including the [British Broadcasting Corporation](https://bbc.co.uk), [Disguise Systems Limited](https://disguise.one) and others in the area of Cinema post production and content delivery. I am the Co-PI of Emerald and our group leads significant work packages in this project. Our key contribution will be to enable granular monitoring and profiling of post production workflows, with an aim to improve the utilisation of AI and automation tools through efficient integration and utilisation of software-hardware accelerators. 

Within TCD, this project will also work closely with the [Sigmedia](https://sigmedia.github.io) group who are involved heavily in optimising content streaming with strong links to Google (YouTube), NetFlix and others. Dr. Hareesh is leading the development of a granular energy measurement framework that will enable accurate profiling of energy consumption of existing post-production computing nodes (e.g., Compositing, Rotoscoping, Denoising). This paves way towards energy-aware development of applications and associated accelerators for sustainable media production in the future. Shashwat Khandelwal is leading the development of highly quantised deep-learning accelerators for high-resolution image manipulation workflows with PCIe-connected FPGA accelerators and their seamless integration with post-production tools such as Foundry's NUKE.
